Welcome to my first blog post!

I'm UltrusBot, if you're reading this on my site, I assume you know who I am, but if you don't, I'm a 
minecraft modder who makes mods like Mob Origins, Missing Wilds, and quite a few others.

I've decided to make a blog, because:
1. I have a unreleased mod that I eventually want to write a blog post about the technical details of it.
2. I was rewriting this website using Astro, and it was very easy to add blog posts to it, so I did.

I'm not sure how often I'll be actually posting on here, but if I do, it'll probably be about random stuff.
